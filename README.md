### Problem Statement

`Management of learning activities is a complex venture in institutions of higher learning. Lecture venues and laboratories are essential but scarce resources. Scheduling a class requires one to consider the nature of the class, the number of students, the time of the day, and whether or not the unit is shared across different programs. Manual designing of timetables thus is a complex and time-consuming affair, which contributes to the loss of valuable time, not to forget the complaints from both students and lecturers over errors in the timetables.`
