### Abstract

`Maseno University is one of the best public universities in Kenya. It offers programs from
certificate to PhD. level. The process of timetabling various course units in the lecture halls is
complicated and time-consuming because it is done manually. The overall objective of this project
is to develop a web-based automated timetabling management system for Maseno University.
Commercially available timetabling systems are too expensive and also do not meet the
requirements at hand for Maseno University. Specifically, the project will be required to; identify
the required modules of the automated timetabling system, design an automated timetabling
system prototype, code the designed prototype, and test the developed prototype. Information for
the modules needed for the development of this system will be gathered from stakeholders
including lecturers, students, and university management. The design will be done through Entity-
Relationship Diagrams (ERD) for the database and Use Case Diagrams for identifying the
interactions between the system and its actors and an Activity Diagram to model the dynamic
aspects of the system i.e. flow from one activity to another. The system will be developed using
html, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, MySQL, and PHP. The system will then be evaluated using the
unit, integration, and system testing. This project proposal shows the potential of using Information
Technology (IT) to automate timetabling.`

### Problem Statement

`Management of learning activities is a complex venture in institutions of higher learning. Lecture venues and laboratories are essential but scarce resources. Scheduling a class requires one to consider the nature of the class, the number of students, the time of the day, and whether or not the unit is shared across different programs. Manual designing of timetables thus is a complex and time-consuming affair, which contributes to the loss of valuable time, not to forget the complaints from both students and lecturers over errors in the timetables.`
