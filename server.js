// The default behavior of the "strictQuery" option in Mongoose,

//Currently, the default is set to true, which means that Mongoose
//will only query for fields that are explicitly defined in the schema.
// However, in version 7, the default will change to false, which means
// that Mongoose will query for all fields, even those that are not explicitly
// defined in the schema. To prepare for this change, you can
// set the "strictQuery" option to false by using the code "mongoose.set('strictQuery', false);".
//If you want to keep the current behavior, you can use "mongoose.set('strictQuery', true);"
//to suppress the warning.
